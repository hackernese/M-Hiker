# M-Hiker
A hiking app for Android devices that enables users to easily save and share their hiking experiences. Implement a cross-platform version using Xamarin/MAUI to extend compatibility.

# No really, why did i build this ?
Let's just make it fast, I didn't want to build this but it was a school project so I built for the sake of it. I prefer Flutter/React Native over the obsolete Android Studio Java and MAUI/Xamarin. Form when it comes to Mobile Development.
So feel free to use it or tweak its code if you think it's a good project ( which I don't think it is, it's just basic CRUD which is boring ðŸ¥±
ðŸ˜´ ). 

# Final words
But since I did put some effort to write it, I'd still like to copyright it or please mention my name or GitHub page if you decide to use it in any possible way... even though really, this project sucks ðŸ˜’


`P.S` : Switch to `MAUI` branch to use the same version of this but in MAUI
