# M-Hiker
A hiking app for Android devices that enables users to easily save and share their hiking experiences. Implement a cross-platform version using Xamarin/MAUI to extend compatibility.

# No really, why did i build this ?
Let's just make it fast, I didn't want to build this but it was a school project so I built for the sake of it. I prefer Flutter/React Native over the obsolete Android Studio Java and MAUI/Xamarin. Form when it comes to Mobile Development.
So feel free to use it or tweak its code if you think it's a good project ( which I don't think it is, it's just basic CRUD which is boring ðŸ¥±
ðŸ˜´ ) 


`P.S` : Switch to `MAUI` branch to use the same version of this but in MAUI
